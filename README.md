# Battleship Console Game
A console Battleship game designed in C#. In this Hasbro classic, five ships will be placed on the board in random locations. The goal of the game is for the user to sink all five ships by target individual sections of the board one grid at a time. Selections are made based on row and column labels, and the console returns a hit or miss indicating whether a ship was placed in that space or not. When all five ships are sunk, the game is over.
